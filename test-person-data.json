                "body": "For any UI devs: \n\nI've starting working on a lemmy front end called [lemmy-ui-leptos](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui-leptos) using [leptos](https://leptos.dev/), a Rust UI framework with isomorphic support, and tailwind + [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for the component styling. This *could* eventually replace the frankenstein's monster that lemmy-ui has become. \n\nSome reasons for doing this: \n\n- lemmy-ui uses infernojs, which is based on the react model. IMO is largely superseded by signal-based reactivity in use in android jetpack-compose, SolidJS, and most new UI frameworks.\n- I had to hack on isomorphic support / server-side-rendering to infernoJS, and it's very messy. Leptos has isomorphic support out of the box.\n- All the benefits of Rust over javascript. \n  - Since leptos is in Rust, we can import the lemmy types directly.\n  - I've been waiting for years for a good rust UI framework, and I think we're finally here with leptos or sycamore.\n- lemmy-ui uses bootstrap, which is showing its age and limitations. Tailwind (and daisyUI) seem to be much more future-proof. \n\nI plan on leaving the site design and component styling to other, more skilled UI devs, while I work mostly on the auth, services, params, and overall back-end structure. \n\n- Please use daisyUI classes tho whenever possible over exhaustive tailwind ones.\n- I'd also like it if the UI could match that of jerboa's (whenever possible), so that a change in one could be represented in the other, and so that things like badge appearance for admins, could be recognizeable across lemmy's front ends.\n\nYou don't really need to learn rust to help out with this, as the components look very similar to JSX. Instructions for running it are in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui-leptos/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) . Feel free to contribute!\n\nRight now only the home page, and post pages are working, but ready to be styled.",

At most this will be a week of hair-pulling, but its vital that we catch any issues before telling other servers to upgrade.",

At most this will be a week of hair-pulling, but its vital that we catch any issues before telling other servers to upgrade.",

                "url": "https://hexbear.net/pictrs/image/8621959e-4fbe-41b1-b522-e194cf2ab14c.png",
                "body": "The Montgomery Bus Boycott in Montgomery, Alabama was a crucial event in the 20th Century Civil Rights Movement. On the evening of December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks, a Montgomery seamstress on her way home from work, refused to give up her seat on the bus for a white man and was subsequently arrested. The President of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), E.D. Nixon, used the arrest to launch a bus boycott to fight the city’s segregated bus policy. Together with Jo Ann Robinson of the Women’s Political Council, and other black leaders, Nixon set plans for the boycott.\n\nThe idea of the boycott had been floating around for months. Both Nixon and Robinson were waiting for a test cast to challenge the segregated bus policy in Court. They knew that they would have large support from black women who made up a majority of the bus users. The only thing missing was a good test candidate and respectable, middle-class Rosa Parks seemed perfect for the role.\n\nOn Friday December 2, Robinson created a flyer which she distributed to black families around Montgomery. The flyer told of the arrest of Parks and mentioned that 75% of the bus riders were blacks and if there was a boycott of the bus system then the city would be forced to pay attention to these customers.  It then called for a boycott of the buses on Monday December 5th.\n\nRobinson arranged a meeting with Rev. Ralph Abernathy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the ministers of two of the largest black churches in the city. While they hesitated at first, they ultimately agreed to participate and held a meeting at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, King’s church, to plan the boycott.  A new organization, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), was created to lead the boycott and Rev. King was appointed its president.  It was also decided that the boycott should continue until the buses were no longer segregated. In order to get people around town during the boycott, the churches bought or rented cars and station wagons to transport people.\n\nMeanwhile boycott supporters challenged the legality of bus segregation in court. Their case, Browder v. Gayle, was eventually heard by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled on November 13, 1956, in favor of the plaintiffs. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956, 381 days after it had begun. The buses in Montgomery were now integrated.\n\n**Megathreads and spaces to hang out:**\n- ❤️ Come listen to music and Watch movies with your fellow [Hexbears nerd, in Cy.tube](https://live.hexbear.net/c/movies) \n- 💖 Come talk in the [New Weekly Queer thread](https://hexbear.net/post/1149995) \n- 💛 Read and talk about a current topics in the [News Megathread](https://hexbear.net/post/1189161)\n- 💚 Come and talk in the [Daily Bloomer Thread](https://hexbear.net/post/1109740)\n- ⭐️ [September Movie Nominations](https://hexbear.net/post/451216) ⭐️\n\n**reminders:**\n- 💚 You nerds can join specific comms to see posts about all sorts of topics\n- 💙 Hexbear’s algorithm prioritizes comments over upbears\n- 💜 Sorting by new you nerd\n- 🌈 If you ever want to make your own megathread, you can reserve a spot [here nerd](https://hexbear.net/post/261657)\n- 🐶 Join the unofficial Hexbear-adjacent Mastodon  [instance toots.matapacos.dog](https://toots.matapacos.dog/explore) \n\n**Links To Resources (Aid and Theory):**\n\n**Aid:**\n- 🌈 [LGBTQ+ Resource Post](https://hexbear.net/post/279079)\n- 💚  [Resources for Palestine](https://buildpalestine.com/2021/05/15/trusted-organizations-to-donate-to-palestine/) \n- [🐌☕ Zapatista Coffee](https://schoolsforchiapas.org/store/coffee-corn-and-agricultural/zapatista-coffee/)\n\n**Theory:**\n- ❤️[Foundations of Leninism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/index.htm) \n- ❤️[Anarchism and Other Essays](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays)",

                "url": "https://hexbear.net/pictrs/image/8621959e-4fbe-41b1-b522-e194cf2ab14c.png",
                "body": "The Montgomery Bus Boycott in Montgomery, Alabama was a crucial event in the 20th Century Civil Rights Movement. On the evening of December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks, a Montgomery seamstress on her way home from work, refused to give up her seat on the bus for a white man and was subsequently arrested. The President of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), E.D. Nixon, used the arrest to launch a bus boycott to fight the city’s segregated bus policy. Together with Jo Ann Robinson of the Women’s Political Council, and other black leaders, Nixon set plans for the boycott.\n\nThe idea of the boycott had been floating around for months. Both Nixon and Robinson were waiting for a test cast to challenge the segregated bus policy in Court. They knew that they would have large support from black women who made up a majority of the bus users. The only thing missing was a good test candidate and respectable, middle-class Rosa Parks seemed perfect for the role.\n\nOn Friday December 2, Robinson created a flyer which she distributed to black families around Montgomery. The flyer told of the arrest of Parks and mentioned that 75% of the bus riders were blacks and if there was a boycott of the bus system then the city would be forced to pay attention to these customers.  It then called for a boycott of the buses on Monday December 5th.\n\nRobinson arranged a meeting with Rev. Ralph Abernathy and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the ministers of two of the largest black churches in the city. While they hesitated at first, they ultimately agreed to participate and held a meeting at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, King’s church, to plan the boycott.  A new organization, the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), was created to lead the boycott and Rev. King was appointed its president.  It was also decided that the boycott should continue until the buses were no longer segregated. In order to get people around town during the boycott, the churches bought or rented cars and station wagons to transport people.\n\nMeanwhile boycott supporters challenged the legality of bus segregation in court. Their case, Browder v. Gayle, was eventually heard by the U.S. Supreme Court which ruled on November 13, 1956, in favor of the plaintiffs. The boycott ended on December 20, 1956, 381 days after it had begun. The buses in Montgomery were now integrated.\n\n**Megathreads and spaces to hang out:**\n- ❤️ Come listen to music and Watch movies with your fellow [Hexbears nerd, in Cy.tube](https://live.hexbear.net/c/movies) \n- 💖 Come talk in the [New Weekly Queer thread](https://hexbear.net/post/1149995) \n- 💛 Read and talk about a current topics in the [News Megathread](https://hexbear.net/post/1189161)\n- 💚 Come and talk in the [Daily Bloomer Thread](https://hexbear.net/post/1109740)\n- ⭐️ [September Movie Nominations](https://hexbear.net/post/451216) ⭐️\n\n**reminders:**\n- 💚 You nerds can join specific comms to see posts about all sorts of topics\n- 💙 Hexbear’s algorithm prioritizes comments over upbears\n- 💜 Sorting by new you nerd\n- 🌈 If you ever want to make your own megathread, you can reserve a spot [here nerd](https://hexbear.net/post/261657)\n- 🐶 Join the unofficial Hexbear-adjacent Mastodon  [instance toots.matapacos.dog](https://toots.matapacos.dog/explore) \n\n**Links To Resources (Aid and Theory):**\n\n**Aid:**\n- 🌈 [LGBTQ+ Resource Post](https://hexbear.net/post/279079)\n- 💚  [Resources for Palestine](https://buildpalestine.com/2021/05/15/trusted-organizations-to-donate-to-palestine/) \n- [🐌☕ Zapatista Coffee](https://schoolsforchiapas.org/store/coffee-corn-and-agricultural/zapatista-coffee/)\n\n**Theory:**\n- ❤️[Foundations of Leninism](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/index.htm) \n- ❤️[Anarchism and Other Essays](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays)",

Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a day of use.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses **large keys with predictable positions**, to prevent your eyes from [hunting and pecking](https://www.keyboardingonline.com/hunting-and-pecking/) for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of [touch-typing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration.",

                "body": "Here is our regular update that explains what we have been working on for the past two weeks. This should allow average users to keep up with development, without reading Github comments or knowing how to program.\n\nIn case you missed the announcement, this week we launched a [redesign of join-lemmy.org together with our first annual funding drive](https://join-lemmy.org/news/2023-10-31_-_Join-Lemmy_Redesign_and_Funding_Drive). Please consider donating to support Lemmy development.\n\nWe are also readying another release candidate `0.19.0-rc.4`. As usual it is available for testing on [voyager.lemmy.ml](https://voyager.lemmy.ml) and by installing the Docker image on your server. There are no breaking changes this time as we are preparing for the final release. It has been one month since we announced the [major breaking changes for 0.19](https://lemmy.ml/post/5711722). In that sense we would like to know from developers of Lemmy clients and frontends if their projects are ready for 0.19, as we are planning to release it within the next weeks. There is no specific release date, but we will first update lemmy.ml to a release candidate, and if it works well publish the new release shortly after.\n\n@nutomic is implementing a [proxy for remote images](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4035), so that clients don't have to connect directly to remote servers and avoid leaking personal information. He also added support for [Arabic and Cyrillic usernames and community names](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4083). Additionally he made various smaller changes and code rewrites, such as ordering [reports](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4129) and [registration applications ](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4123) by oldest first.\n\n@dessalines has implemented [numerous minor bug fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adessalines+created%3A2023-10-21..2023-11-03+is%3Amerged+). This includes [disabling voting for bot accounts](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4100), a change to the hot rank to [avoid content getting pushed off the feed after mass downvoting](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4085), and more. Also added an [Platform filter](https://github.com/LemmyNet/joinlemmy-site/pull/259) for the join-lemmy.org/apps page, and fixed a memory issue.\n\n\n@phiresky is extending the `/api/v3/site/federated_instances` endpoint to [include error count and time of last successful](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4104) send for each linked instance. This will allow determining the exact state of federation between all instances.\n\n@SleeplessOne1917 made two minor improvements to [2FA code input](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui/pull/2199) and to the [search page](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui/pull/2201).\n\n@hackerncoder [relaxed the check for valid displaynames](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/4079) to allow more unicode symbols.\n\n## Support development\n\n@dessalines and @nutomic are working full-time on Lemmy to integrate community contributions, fix bugs, optimize performance and much more. This work is funded exclusively through donations. \n\nIf you like using Lemmy, and want to make sure that we will always be available to work full time building it, consider [donating to support its development](https://join-lemmy.org/donate). Recurring donations are ideal because they allow for long-term planning. But also one-time donations of any amount help us. \n\n- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Lemmy) (preferred option)\n- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/lemmy)\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dessalines)\n- [Cryptocurrency](https://join-lemmy.org/donate) (scroll to bottom of page)\n",

Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a day of use.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses **large keys with predictable positions**, to prevent your eyes from [hunting and pecking](https://www.keyboardingonline.com/hunting-and-pecking/) for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of [touch-typing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration.",

It led to an explosive growth in Lemmy users, and lots of urgent work in scaling, bug fixes, user onboarding and more. Since then things have calmed down significantly, giving us breathing room and time to get more long-term work done.\n> \n> As of Nov. 2023, Lemmy is at **~36k active daily users** 🥳 (_those who have posted or commented within the last month_). While user counts are not an explicit goal of ours, this is still a tremendous achievement, and one which we can all be proud to be a part of. It shows that people _truly do_ want alternatives to US tech companies, and will use them if they exist.\n> \n> ## Join-Lemmy Redesign\n> \n> Most recently we've been working on a redesign of join-lemmy.org to provide a better onboarding experience and cater towards new users. This includes:\n> \n> - A helpful new [instance picker](http://join-lemmy.org/?showJoinModal=true) to reduce [choice overload](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/choice-overload).\n> - The [instances page](http://join-lemmy.org/instances) is now _filterable_, based a set of topics and languages, as well as _sortable_ based on activity.

This funding was based on getting paid for implementing new features, specified in advance.\n> \n> We've known that this funding could not last indefinitely, and that after several years of funding, NLnet's resources are better spent getting other projects up and running. Additionally, much of our time is spent on other equally important work: reviewing changes from community contributors, fixing bugs, doing support, and various organizational tasks.\n> \n> That is why we are launching our first **annual funding drive**. The goal is to increase monthly, recurring donations from currently €4.000 to at least €12.000. With this amount @dessalines and @nutomic can each receive a yearly salary of €50.000 which is in line with [median developer salaries](https://www.developersalary.com/). It will also allow one additional developer to work fulltime on Lemmy and speed up development.\n> \n> Recurring donations from Lemmy users are the most sustainable solution for the future. It also means that we need to worry less about funding, and can focus more on improving Lemmy. And instead of being accountable to an external organization, we work **directly for Lemmy's users**. While one-time donations are also welcome, they are too unpredictable for long-term planning.\n> \n> You can find available donation options on the [donate page](http://join-lemmy.org/donate). This page was also updated during the redesign to display current donations and funding goals. If each active Lemmy user donated **~€0.33 per month** it would be enough for 3 full-time developers. So please consider donating if you use Lemmy every day. Our preferred donation platform is Liberapay because it doesn't have any payment fees or delays, and is itself open source.\n> \n> Besides Lemmy's developers, please consider donating to those who develop open-source apps or software for the Lemmy ecosystem, as well as server admins and moderation teams who are the backbone of the Lemmyverse. We would be happy to add donation links for the above to join-lemmy.org as well!\n> \n> If you have any suggestions in regards to the topics mentioned in this post, please let us know.

Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a day of use.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses **large keys with predictable positions**, to prevent your eyes from [hunting and pecking](https://www.keyboardingonline.com/hunting-and-pecking/) for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of [touch-typing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration.",

                "name": "Lemmy 0.19 Breaking Changes",
                "body": "We are getting closer to the next major release.  This version will have many breaking changes, so we are listing them here for app and client developers to adjust their projects.\n\nAs we prepare for the release of Lemmy `0.19.0`, we'd like to provide any app or client developers ample time to upgrade their apps, as well as discover any problems, before we do the release. This will be **at least 4 weeks from now** (but likely longer).\n\nServer admins can also upgrade to the latest release candidates for testing. Be aware that they are still unstable and shouldn't be used in production. As with any upgrade it is important to have working backups in place.\n\nIt should be possible for clients to support both Lemmy 0.18 and 0.19 without major workarounds. If backwards compatibility is causing you trouble, comment below and we will help to find a solution.\n\nTo test, you can point your app to the following test instance running a release candidate of `0.19.0`:  https://voyager.lemmy.ml\n\nA diff of API changes is here: [lemmy-js-client API changes from 0.18.3 -> 0.19.0-rc's](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client/compare/0.18.3...0.19.0-rc.13)\n\n*Note for developers not using typescript or rust*: \n\nIf you'd like to auto-generate an API client for your language, you can try out [@MV-GH's lemmy_openapi_spec](https://github.com/MV-GH/lemmy_openapi_spec), or (if in kotlin), use Jerboa's [script here](https://github.com/dessalines/jerboa/blob/main/copy_generated_types_from_lemmy_js_client.sh).\n\n## Major Changes\n\n### Authentication\n\nPrevious Lemmy versions used to take authentication as query/post parameters. This is insecure and unnecessarily complicated. With `0.19`, the `jwt` token can be passed either as cookie with name `auth`, or as header in the form `Authorization: Bearer `. \n\nA major advantage is that this allows us to send proper cache-control headers, with responses to unauthenticated users being cacheable. It also prevents token leaks in web server logs. The login and registration endpoints attempt to set the cookie automatically. If that is supported on your platform, you don't have to worry about the authentication token at all. \n\nIn order for your client to be compatible with both Lemmy `0.18` and `0.19`, you should send auth in both ways. Meaning with each API call, send the old `auth` query/post parameter, as well as the new header or cookie.\n\nA few PRs detailing these changes:\n\n- https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3725\n- https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3926\n- https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3946\n- https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3982\n\n### Users can block instances\n\nUsers can now block instances, so that their communities are hidden from listings. This is done via `POST /api/v3/site/block` with parameters `int instance_id, bool block`.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3869\n\n### New sort options\n\nA new `scaled` sort option has been added. This sort is identical to the `Hot` sort, but also takes into account the number of each community's active monthly users, and so helps to boost posts from *less active* communities to the top.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3907\n\n### 2FA / TOTP Rework\n\nTwo-Factor-Authentication is now enabled in a two-step process to avoid locking yourself out. Now a secret needs to be generated first with `POST /api/v3/user/totp/generate` (no parameters). The generated token needs to be added by the user to an authenticator app. \n\nOnce this is completed, 2FA can be enabled with `POST /api/v3/user/totp/update`. This takes a string parameter `totp_token` (generated by authenticator app), and boolean `enabled`. 2FA can be disabled again with the same `update` endpoint. Additionally, the 2FA algorithm has been changed to `SHA1` for better compatibility.\n\nThe update disables 2FA for all accounts, so that users who are locked out can use their accounts again, and to ease the transition to the `SHA1` algorithm.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3959\n\n### Timestamps now include timezone\n\nPrevious Lemmy versions used timestamps without any timezone internally. This caused problems when federating with other software that uses timezones. \n\nGoing forward, all timestamps in the API are switching from timestamps without time zone (`2023-09-27T12:29:59.113132`) to `ISO8601` timestamps (e.g. `2023-10-29T15:10:51.557399+01:00` or `Z` suffix). In order to be compatible with both 0.18 and 0.19, parse the timestamp as `ISO8601` and add a `Z` suffix if it fails (for older versions).\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3496\n\n### Cursor based pagination\n\n`0.19` adds support for cursor based pagination on the `/api/v3/post/list` endpoint. This is more efficient for the database. Instead of a query parameter `?page=3`, listing responses now include a field `\"next_page\": \"Pa46c\"` which needs to be passed as `?page_cursor=Pa46c`. The existing pagination method is still supported for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in the next version.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3872\n\n### New endpoints for export/import of user settings data\n\nUsers can now export their profile settings data (including subscriptions and blocklists) via `GET /api/v3/user/export`. The returned JSON data should not be parsed by clients, but directly downloaded as a file. Backups can be imported via `POST /api/v3/user/import`.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3976\n\n### Make remove content optional during account deletion\n\nWhen a user deletes their own account using `POST /api/v3/user/delete_account`, there is a new parameter called `delete_content`. If it is true, all posts, comments and other content created by the user are deleted (this is the previous default behaviour). If it is false, only the user profile will be marked as deleted.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3817\n\n### Outgoing Federation Queue\n\nThe federation queue has been rewritten to be much more performant and reliable. This is irrelevant for client developers, but admins should look out for potential federation problems. If you run multiple Lemmy backends for horizontal scaling, be sure to read the [updated documentation](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration/horizontal_scaling.html) and set the new configuration parameters. The [Troubleshooting](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/administration/troubleshooting.html) section has information about how to find out the state of the federation queues.\n\nhttps://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/pull/3605",

Initial testing shows that you can reach ~25 words per minute after a day of use.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses **large keys with predictable positions**, to prevent your eyes from [hunting and pecking](https://www.keyboardingonline.com/hunting-and-pecking/) for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of [touch-typing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing), your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) [MessageEase Keyboard](https://www.exideas.com/ME/), which is its main inspiration.",
